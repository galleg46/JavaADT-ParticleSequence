# ADT-ParticleSequence
A homework assignment where I implement a data type that represents a sequence of particles and use it to simulate gravity between multiple planets.

This ADT will make use of particle objects. These are being stored/retrieved from an array. 

The ParticleSeq ADT is a variant of the Sequence ADT from our textbook.

This assignment was also my first look at invariants. The invariants in this program check to make sure the data structure is not effected when changes are being made to it.
